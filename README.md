Still some issues for trying to label entire folders at once - I'll get around to that when I need to use it but in the meantime feel free to fix it :)


## Installation and usage

1. Clone the project:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cadecrow/image-labeler.git
    ```

2. Enter the directory and install the dependencies (you might need to use ```pip3``` instead of ```pip```):
    ```bash
    cd image-labeler
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the app (use ```python3``` for Python 3)
   ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
